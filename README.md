# PSO2 JP Token Generator
This is a token generator for the game Phantasy Star Online 2. It takes in a username and password (and optionally OTP code), and then generates a token that can be used with the [PSO2 Tweaker](http://arks-layer.com) to launch the game. When launched in this way, you no longer need to enter your login credentials at the ship selection screen, making logging in and switching characters much less painless.

Since this deals with sensitive data, I have made this portion completely open source, so you can see exactly what is happening with your username/password/OTP code.
